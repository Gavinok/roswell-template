* A simple lisp template that can be used with Roswell

Roswell's templates may not be stable but here is a quick one for you to try

#+begin_src bash
  git clone https://github.com/Gavinok/roswell-template

  cd roswell-template

  ros template import .
#+end_src


Then in a directory you want to start your project in

#+begin_src bash
  ros init sample-template project_name
#+end_src

* Running Your Project
While this uses roswell for the runtime the actual executable is
produced using asdf. For this reason I added a ~Makefile~ to make
building a one liner for you.

#+begin_src bash
  make
#+end_src

If you wanna use ~qlot~ to manage your dependencies just run

#+begin_src bash
  make qlot
#+end_src
